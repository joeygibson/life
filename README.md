# Conway's Game of Life in Go

This is a simple, and probably na√Øve, implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life), written in [Go](http://golang.org/). 

## Dependencies
The version on `master` uses NCurses through the [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) library. You'll need to fetch it with

    go get github.com/nsf/termbox-go

## Installation
Next, `get` this code and install it

    go install github.com/joeygibson/life

and you will have an executable called `life` in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
